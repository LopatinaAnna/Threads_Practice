# Threads practice

<h3>Create two threads and a collection for numbers. </h3>
One thread writes the primes, the other reads them. </br>
Each read should take place after the first thread adds 5 new numbers to the collection.</br> 
When the count of numbers reaches 15, the thread for reading outputs these numbers, the 'Finish' appears on the console and the program ends.
